<small><i>The Birth of Stentor</i></small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">It is some eight thousand years ago that
Man, having already set himself apart
from the brute creation by walking on two
legs and creating the art of speech, paved
the way to the “best seller” by the invention
of writing.</p>

<p>The nomad settled in the village. From
the village there grew the city. Empires
rose, fell, and crumbled into decay. Plato,
Homer, Aristotle, Dante, da Vinci, Shakespeare
enlarged the boundaries of intellect
and of emotion. America was rediscovered.
Moveable types were introduced to Europe.
And the newspaper, via the printed book
and the pamphlet, sprang from the loins of
Gutenberg. Grub Street gave place to Fleet
Street, and the Carmelites to Carmelite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
House. Compulsory schooling for the
masses produced a new social phenomenon
in the shape of whole nations among whom
the illiterate was the exception, and Demos
roared voraciously for newsprint. And the
halfpenny “daily” created a demand for the
forest products of Newfoundland.</p>

<p>So may our grandchildren condense their
Outline of History.</p>

<p>Historically considered, the Newspaper is
an upstart, although its germs existed in the
Roman Empire in the shape of <i lang="la">Acta Diurna</i>
and <i lang="la">Acta Publica</i>, Government publications
which contained registers of births and
deaths, and particulars of the corn supply
and of payments into the Treasury. The
<i lang="la">Acta</i> even embodied so modern a feature as
the Court Circular.</p>

<p>Journalism found no incitement during the
Dark and Middle Ages, and the use of moveable
types at first stimulated the production
of books rather than that of periodicals. By
the latter half of the fifteenth century, rudimentary
journals were, however, making
their more or less regular appearance in
Germany, Austria, and Italy, and embedded
in Continental archives is to be found at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
least one copy of a contemporary account of
Columbus’ voyages to America recorded
while his journeyings still represented the
latest news.</p>

<p>The sixteenth century saw the <i lang="it">Gazzetta</i>,
an Italian production in manuscript, to be
read on payment of a <i lang="it">gazzetta</i>, a small coin
of the period, which eventually gave its name
as a synonym for newspapers and other publications.
None of these Continental attempts
to assuage the thirst for news seems,
however, to have embodied the seeds of
permanence, and the idea of a Newspaper
in the modern sense, that is, of a publication
issued at regular intervals and characterised
by continuity in administration and policy, is
largely English. The first regular English
newspaper was the <cite>Weekly News from Italy,
Germany, etc.</cite>, founded in 1622, and nineteen
years later an English paper secured a
“scoop” by publishing a report of a Parliamentary
debate for the first time on
record. In 1709, London had its first daily
under the title of the <cite>Daily Courant</cite>; the
<cite>Morning Post</cite> dates back to 1772; and the
<cite>Times</cite>, originally established as the <cite>Daily
Universal Register</cite>, followed in 1785.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>It is almost impossible to assign a definite
historical date for the inception of the newspaper
as a regular institution created to
satisfy a public demand, since so many of
the journalistic pioneers were both of a fugitive
and ephemeral nature, whilst others
were pamphlets rather than news bulletins.
But if we strike a mean between the <cite>Daily
Courant</cite> and the <cite>Morning Post</cite>, we may say
that the newspaper has enjoyed some two
centuries of vigorous life. It has thus witnessed
the birth of the Industrial Age and
of its offspring, Mechanical Transport, has
seen the formation of the United States of
America, the peopling of Canada and Australia,
the fall of most European thrones,
the development of great communities in
South America, the birth of flying, and the
shifting of the centre of gravity of political
power from the semi-instructed few to the
uninstructed many. If Stentor has lost his
head a trifle at the contemplation of such an
unparalleled record of human activity, and
of a period pregnant with such almost unimaginable
possibilities for good and evil,
who shall wonder?</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">What is a newspaper? Ask any editor
or proprietor, and he will tell you that
its primary function is the dissemination of
news, and its secondary, but none the less
immensely important, task is that of commenting
on the happenings of to-day or forecasting
those of to-morrow, with the object
of educating the community and guiding public
opinion. So we are frequently informed,
in rotund periods, by noble lords who respond
to the toast of The Press at public
feastings.</p>

<p>What, actually, is a newspaper? To begin
with, it contains advertisements, mainly
of women’s dress, soaps, face creams and
powders, chocolate, beer, whisky, tobacco,
and motor cars. Democracy’s needs.</p>

<p>Then there is a page of pictures, gathered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
at great expense from the ends of the earth,
often transmitted by aeroplane, and providing
a feast of new hats and evening wraps
from Paris, railway accidents, shipwrecks,
upturned tramcars and motor lorries that
have fallen into ditches, the more or less
recognisable portraits of men and women
performing at the Divorce Courts or for
some other reason temporarily in the public
eye, photographs of film actresses, and
pictures of the diversions of the Rich
at the races, on the moors, on the Lido,
and on the Riviera. Democracy’s peep-show.</p>

<p>After these hors d’œuvres come the leading
articles, letters to the editor, “nature
notes” straight from Fleet Street, an instalment
of a serial story depicting a life such as
was never lived on land or sea, pictures which
are believed to amuse the children, and
“leader page articles” largely contributed
(or at least signed) by doctors, divines, the
wives of ex-Cabinet Ministers, Russian
Princesses, actresses, and—occasionally—journalists.</p>

<p>There are also articles in which women
are instructed how to dress, cook, arrange a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
luncheon table, plan schemes of interior
decoration, pack their trunks for a holiday,
economise in the household, and retain the
affection of their husbands.</p>

<p>The residue is news.</p>

<p>But not all of it.</p>

<p>For much of this residue is news only in
a specialised and restricted sense. City
notes, produce market notes, the movements
of shipping, and golf, bridge, gardening, or
motoring notes do not appeal to every
reader. Nor, for that matter, does literary
criticism, or the critiques of plays, films, concerts,
and picture exhibitions.</p>

<p>But the residue of the residue is news.
And that includes “gossip” by ladies and
gentlemen apparently on terms of the utmost
intimacy with Royalty and the nobility
and gentry, the deaths of centenarians, the
bright sayings of witnesses at police courts,
the witty sayings of judges, the wise sayings
of magistrates, and the futile sayings of
coroners.</p>

<p>Add a crossword puzzle, and you have a
newspaper. Democracy’s Mentor.</p>

<p>New inventions and institutions achieve
popularity in accordance with the readiness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
with which they lend themselves to vulgarisation.
So it has been with wireless and the
kinema, and so it is with the Press. Cynics
may say that every country has the newspapers
it deserves, but that begs the question.
The mass of the public undoubtedly likes its
newspapers well enough (without having any
very great respect for them) but it also likes
novels and film plays entirely devoid of artistic
value, just as it likes third-rate music
and fourth-rate pictures. The real question
is how far is popular taste natural, and how
far has it been debauched by those who aim
at giving the public what it wants, or what
it is supposed to want. A brewer who succeeds
in inducing his customers to acquire a
taste for doctored or synthetic beer may be
entitled to say that he is giving them what
they like. But he is not entitled to say that
they are incapable of appreciating unadulterated
malt and hops, or that they would
really prefer the genuine article if they
were allowed a free choice between the
two.</p>

<p>When compulsory schooling led to an
immense and sudden increase in the number
of people able to read without difficulty, well-meaning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
enthusiasts rejoiced at the prospect
of the artisan beguiling his leisure with
Dante, Milton, Schopenhauer, Ruskin, Darwin,
George Eliot, or the works of Alfred
Lord Tennyson. Actually, these newcomers
to the world of letters turned mostly
to the penny novelette and the “bitty”
weekly. They might have patronised something
better if the pioneers of reading matter
for the million had made the experiment of
seeing whether there was a market for something
better. But the experiment was not
made. And it was on the basis of a culture
largely represented by the “snippety”
weekly, that the creators of newspapers for
the million began to build about a generation
ago.</p>

<p>Let it be conceded that their intentions
were largely laudable. The appeal of the
newspaper had previously been restricted to
a degree almost incredible to contemporary
men and women under thirty. The daily
paper was the preserve of the well-to-do
and the “comfortable classes”; the masses
bought evening papers for racing tips and
other sporting information, and on Sundays
they were regaled with a ragôut of the murders,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the robberies, the assaults, the divorces,
and the more unsavoury police court cases of
the week. Journals of international repute,
such as the <cite>Times</cite>, the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>, the
<cite lang="la">Neue Freie Presse</cite>, the <cite lang="fr">Journal des Débats</cite>,
sold fewer copies in a week than the popular
organs now dispose of in a day.</p>

<p>The Harmsworths, the Pearsons, the
Hearsts, were to change all that. In order
to make the daily paper a necessity, or a
habit, of the masses, it was essential to depart
from the pomposity of the older
journals, with their long and platitudinous
leading articles about nothing in particular,
their unattractive “make-up,” their bald
presentation of news, the immense length of
their police court reports, and their adherence
to the theory that the fall of a Cabinet
in Patagonia was of more interest to the
reader than a murder on his doorstep. The
motto of the new Press was Brightness,
Brevity, Enterprise, and Cheapness. It introduced
photographs. It presented its news
more attractively. It catered for the interests
of women. It printed the light, but
informative, article on topics of the day,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
often written by a specialist. It quickened
up the transmission both of the news and of
the newspaper. It aimed, in short, at mirroring
passing events for the multitude
rather than providing reading matter to be
digested at leisure by the banker, the lawyer,
the country gentleman, and the politician.
And it succeeded remarkably—up to a
point.</p>

<p>But man cannot live by brightness alone.
And brightness became a fetish. Insensibly,
and on the whole probably unconsciously, at
least at first, the newspaper made excessive
sacrifices in the pursuit of its passion for the
purely readable. It concentrated on the tabloid
and the snippet. It plastered its pages
with pictures, so that we have reached the
stage at which if Dean Inge, Bernard Shaw,
the ex-Kaiser, President Coolidge, Mr.
Lloyd George, or Mr. Charles Chaplin be
mentioned on six consecutive days of the
week by the same paper, each mention will be
accompanied by a photograph, usually the
same photograph, the size of a postage
stamp. Similarly, the obsession of the Press
for “human interest stories” (a characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
legitimate enough in itself) has been developed
to the point at which the wives and
mothers of condemned murderers are interviewed
directly after the verdict with a request
for their comments on the justice of
the sentence, while respectable householders
are despatched with cameras to photograph
the tears of miners’ widows after a colliery
accident.</p>

<p>“Human interest” with a vengeance. But
the worst feature of this vulgarisation of the
popular Press is the resulting vulgarisation
of the public. News editors would not instruct
their reporters to interview divorcées,
husbands whose wives have just been killed
in motor accidents, or bereaved mothers, unless
journalistic insistence as the “personal
touch” had so greatly succeeded in banning
decent reticence. The law does not punish
such outrages on public taste, although it
punishes many offences of far smaller detriment
to the community.</p>

<p>Side by side with vulgarisation is persistent
falsification of values. The Press promotes
mass hysteria, as is shown by the excesses
accompanying the visits of American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
film stars to England or of European queens
to the United States. It consistently denounces
the very evils, or imaginary evils for
whose creation it is itself so largely responsible,
finding, for instance, good “copy” both
in detailed descriptions of a play alleged to
be lewd, and in criticisms of the same play
by clergymen who have not seen it. And it
is driving privacy from the world by its discovery
of the new creed that if the pen be
mightier than the sword, the camera is
mightier than either.</p>

<p>Insistence on the personal note has also
brought in its train a Mumbo-Jumbo belief
in the virtue of names. It is assumed that
the public will attach more importance to an
article signed with a name with which it is
familiar than by an unsigned contribution,
and although this theory is based on a certain
element of fact, it is in practice overworked
to the point of nausea. The reader
will no doubt attach special importance to an
article under the signature of Arnold Bennett,
or H. G. Wells, especially if it deal
with a subject with which the writer is particularly
identified. He will also be more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
impressed by an article on tennis by Suzanne
Lenglen than by an equally good but anonymous
contribution. But is he equally impressed
by the fact that a column of platitudes
on motherhood, the contemporary
young woman, or the decay of church-going,
is signed by a, no doubt, estimable lady,
whose only claim to public distinction is that
she is the wife of an ex-Lord Mayor or the
bearer of an obscure Hungarian title?
Editors and proprietors apparently think so,
thus indicating their cynical estimate of the
level of public intelligence.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this passion for names is
responsible for the perpetration of the
grossest frauds on the public. It is notorious
in Fleet Street that articles alleged to be contributed
by politicians, musical comedy actresses,
film stars, and professional footballers
are, in fact, often not written by the
illustrious who are their reputed authors. Indeed,
the illustrious are as like as not incapable
of writing a page of grammatical
English, as is also the case with the self-advertising
commercial magnate, whose reputed
views on economic questions or industrial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
co-operation, neatly typed and flanked
by carefully touched-up photographs, descend
on the desks of editors in the company of
the pigeon-English letters of pushful publicity
agents.</p>

<p>But this fraud on the public, and there is
no other name for a species of false pretence
which is growing so rapidly that it is developing
into an open scandal, is, relatively, a
minor affair. The real evil is that the controllers
of the Press, themselves largely amateurs,
are going out of their way to encourage
the incursion of the amateur into what
is a highly-skilled and highly-complex avocation.
And that constitutes the real false pretence.
It does not matter very much whether
that popular film comedienne, Miss Ruby
Vamp, is actually responsible or not for the
article on “Should Curates Charleston?”
extensively and expensively advertised by
the “Daily Dope.” But it does matter if
the public be led to believe that an article on
foreign relations written to order by a hack
journalist for the purpose of provoking a
sensation or promoting the policy of a newspaper
proprietor should purport to be, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
should be accepted, as from the pen of an
impartial diplomatic expert, who has, in fact,
only lent his name in return for money or for
purposes of self-advertisement.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> In December last, the Lawn Tennis Association passed
resolutions prohibiting a competitor in tournaments and
matches from writing articles thereon for the Press
“under his own name, initials, or recognisable pseudonym,”
and also from allowing a player to permit his
name to be “advertised as the author of any book or
press article of which he is not the actual author.” This
resolution was boycotted by a portion of the Combine
Press, while one newspaper distorted the attitude of the
Association as representing “interference with amateurs,”
and “dictating to newspaper proprietors and editors.”
Imperence.</p>

<small><i>The Dictators</i></small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Few people understand the economic,
still less the social, significance of Trusts
and Combines. The public is familiar
enough with the amalgamation of a number
of more or less competing concerns engaged
in the same industry; it is not so familiar
with the conception of a Trust which owns or
controls undertakings of widely-differing nature,
such as the modern Combine which
aims at controlling an article during the
whole cycle of operations from the winning
of the raw material to the marketing of the
finished product. Still less is it familiar with
the process whereby control, which is far
more important than ownership, can be acquired
by putting up quite a small proportion
of the total capital invested in a commercial
undertaking.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> A large proportion of the capital of modern joint-stock
companies is provided by debenture-holders, who
normally have no voting rights whatever, and by preference
share-holders, who may vote at meetings only
when their dividend has been in arrears for a prescribed
period. Even ordinary share-holders may have no voting
rights, and the entire control, including the appointment
of directors, can be vested in the owners of a particular
class of share representing less than a tenth of the company’s
total capital.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>It is as the result of control rather than
actual ownership that the British Press has
within the past few years largely come into
the hands of some four or five men. The
Independent Press has, in consequence, almost
ceased to exist. There are still, of
course, newspapers uncontrolled by Combines
or Trusts, but these are in the main restricted
alike as to circulation, influence, and the
range of their geographical distribution.
Moreover, independence of ownership does
not necessarily mean independence of control
by a political party in whose interests
the paper is administered by its nominal
owners.</p>

<p>The “Trustification” of the Press is an
entirely logical development, and has been
accepted by the public in much the same way
as amalgamations in any other industry.
But there is a vital difference between a
Newspaper Trust and a Beef Trust. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Newspaper Trust controls and manipulates
public opinion. Its workings are largely subterranean.
It is guided on occasion by purely
political considerations to an extent impossible
in any other industry. It may exercise
a decisive influence on the issue of war
or peace. Obviously, the control of a nation’s
Press by a handful of men is not to be
regarded in the same light as the control of
its chemical industry. A “deal” in newspapers
embodies, ultimately, a “deal” in
the means of manipulating public opinion.</p>

<p>In every industry, the appetite for amalgamation
grows by what it feeds on. The
tendency is for the immensely powerful and
wealthy Newspaper Trusts to absorb more
and more publications. Very often, a competing
organ is bought only that it may be
“killed,” as happened to London’s oldest
evening paper, <cite>The Globe</cite>. Amalgamation
is often only a euphemistic term for the disappearance
of an old-established paper. The
independent journals cannot withstand the
tentacles of the Octopus. Either they are
forced out of existence by sheer inability to
stand up against their much wealthier rivals,
or the owners are induced to sell by offers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
too tempting to refuse. In the latter instance,
the matter has usually been decided
on down to the last detail by the directors on
both sides before the offer is submitted to the
share-holders who are the nominal and legal
owners of the property.</p>

<p>The Dictators of Public Opinion thus enlarge
their realm. It may be asked why,
granted that the disappearance of existing
Independent Newspapers is inevitable, new
Independent organs do not make their appearance.
The answer is that few undertakings
involve the risk of such great loss,
coupled with so much uncertainty and the
necessity of putting up so much working
capital to provide for possible losses during
the first two or three years of existence, as
the launching of a great newspaper. Excluding
a journal subsidised by Labour organisations,
only one serious attempt has
been made in England during the last twenty
years to found a new morning paper of national
scope. It failed, after its millionaire
proprietor had tired of losing money on the
venture. The last attempt to establish a
new London evening paper failed on the
score of finance, distribution alone (<i>i.e.</i>, getting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
the paper into the hands of readers
after it had been printed) costing a thousand
pounds a week. London, which is the journalistic
centre of the United Kingdom (the
small size of the country making possible
the “nation-wide” newspaper, with which
there is nothing really comparable in the
United States), has actually far fewer morning
and evening papers than twenty years
ago.</p>

<p>It has more Sunday papers. But that is
one of the results of Trustification. By
placing a Sunday paper under the same control
as one or more morning and evening
journals, overhead charges, which eat up
money in the newspaper industry, are largely
reduced. Administrative and mechanical
costs are lowered. Each paper in the Combine
can give free publicity to the rest. Distribution
costs are shared. Against such conditions,
the lone hand fights a losing battle,
and economic factors operate as much
against the creation of new Independent
journals as they operate for the absorption
of those still in existence.</p>

<p>Since the armistice, the process of Trustification
has undergone a remarkable acceleration.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
It has also entered on a new and
immensely significant phase, the unification
of control of publications of the most widely
differing nature, thus bringing illustrated
weeklies, fashion papers, monthly magazines,
technical and trade journals, children’s
weeklies and monthlies, and directories and
other works of reference under the same
ownership as morning, evening, and Sunday
Newspapers. The modern Combine
will even control the manufacture of its
paper, and the supply of raw material for
the purpose.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> See <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Such comprehensive Trustification may
either assume the shape of complete amalgamation
of separate companies, or be
effected by the process known as unification
of interests, in which a common control is
brought about by such means as the presence
of the same men, or their nominees, on
the boards of companies which retain their
corporate entity but are animated by a common
policy and administered to serve common
interests. The result is in either instance
the same.</p>

<p>The world has never known anything comparable.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
A handful of men, sitting over a
luncheon table, can decree what the community
is to think, what it is to be told, what
it is not to be told. So we have reached the
“Fordisation” of the intellect, which works
through mass suggestion reinforced by damnable
iteration. And this is mainly the work,
not of men with missions, not of enthusiasts,
or patriots, or men of culture, not even of
journalists, but of men who have “gone
into” the newspaper industry as they might
have “gone into” the establishment of
bacon-curing factories.</p>

<p>Does it require a prophet to forecast the
colossal influence of the Dictators on the
opinions, the conduct, and the ideals of the
next generation?</p>

<p>For the process of Trustification cannot be
arrested. Law and public opinion are alike
powerless to stem it. No Anti-Trust legislation,
as has been proved by America, is
ever or can ever be of the smallest effect,
since there are too many means of evading
the spirit of the law while adhering to the
letter. Interlocking directorates, ownership
of shares carrying control over the entire
undertaking, secret arrangements for pooling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
profits, are among the common methods
adopted in order to set up a <em>de facto</em> Trust
when it may not be legal or politic to establish
a Trust in name. Newspapers which
succeed in maintaining a semblance of independent
ownership and independent policy
will thus be brought within the orbit of the
Combines although they may nominally remain
outside. The Trusts will become
Super-Trusts, and the Press of the whole
country may be dominated by two, three, or
even one combine, with a single individual as
Arch-Dictator.</p>

<p>The process is inevitable, even if only for
the reason that the splitting up of a Trust
that has once been formed entails reduction
in profits. Northcliffe, who was above and
beyond everything else a journalist, aimed
merely at the supreme control of the journals
created by his genius. The contemporary
Dictators, who are not journalists,
aim at dominion over the whole field of
the Press. They have already gone most
of the way towards attaining their ambition.</p>

<p>A special factor which has received very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
little consideration will operate in the near
future towards the tightening of the stranglehold
of the Press Combines. Trustification
of the Newspaper Industry has recommended
itself to financiers on the ground,
<i lang="la">inter alia</i>, that it enables expenditure to be
cut down. The history of nearly every industrial
combine, excepting those affecting
the Press, has since the armistice been one of
profits that have failed to come up to the
promoters’ estimates. In numerous instances,
despite the considerable economies foreshadowed
in the prospectus, earnings have
been materially lower than those of the former
separate undertakings now under one
control. Indeed, the process of amalgamation
or of acquiring controlling interests has
during the past few years been in general
disappointing to share-holders.</p>

<p>Until now, the Newspaper Trusts have
been more fortunate, partly because certain
classes of advertisers have been induced to
spend much more money, partly because of
the economies effected by the wholesale
discharge of staffs consequent on the so-called
amalgamation of papers which have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
been bought only that they might be
“killed”;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and in part because the results of
acquiring share-holdings at fancy prices have
yet to materialise.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> “<cite>The Yorkshire Evening Argus</cite> having been amalgamated
with the <cite>Bradford Daily Telegraph</cite>, the Editor
of the former paper (Mr. J. W. Masters) confidently
recommends the members of his loyal and competent staff
to all who need literary assistance, and would be glad to
receive applications from editors and others having positions
to offer.”—Advertisement in the <cite>Times</cite>, December
15, 1926.</p>

</div>

<p>This prosperity cannot be expected to last
indefinitely. The newspaper brokers, that
new class of financial intermediary which is
playing so significant a part in the making
of “deals” in public opinion, have done uncommonly
well out of their buyings and sellings.
They may still do well in the immediate
future, but they have no concern with
the ultimate prosperity of the industry. The
future position of share-holders in the Press
Trusts does not seem so assured as they
imagine to-day. As profits decline, or fail
to increase in accordance with expectations,
the dictators will decree reductions in expenditure,
beginning with the human material
which has created their profits and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
goodwill. The desire for economy, which is
on the whole more likely to be attained by
means of centralised administration than
with a number of separate and individual
undertakings, will obviously outweigh any
arguments that might be brought forward in
favour of “unscrambling” the Press Trusts,
or splitting up the Combines into smaller
undertakings. Furthermore, when the
Trusts feel the pinch, or regard their profits
as insufficiently bloated, the ambition to
drive out what remains of the Independent
Press will be accentuated, and yet more
journals outside the Combines will be forced
to surrender.</p>

<p>With the process of Trustification has
come a complete change in the character of
the Controllers of the Press. Men such as
Delane of the <cite>Times</cite> were great editors, that
is, great journalists, who stamped their impress
on an age which still held to the belief
that the editor was responsible for the editorial
policy of his paper, and was something
more than the mere paid servant of his
proprietors, to be engaged and discharged
as one “hires and fires” a scullery maid.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Men such as Northcliffe (with all his faults
a great man and one with a touch of that
indefinable quality which we term genius)
were possessed of creative ideas; they had
vision and ideals; they saw in the newspaper
something more than a mere instrument for
money-making. If they made money it was
not because it was their primary ambition to
do so, or even because they particularly cared
about money, but because their creations
could not help attaining a considerable degree
of material success.</p>

<p>To-day, with negligible exceptions which
are unlikely to be perpetuated, editors are
merely hired servants. A. C. P. Scott is
an exception.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Another Delane is an impossibility.
Another Northcliffe is unthinkable,
since the new Dictators have
fashioned the rôle of the Press, and their
own rôle, after a diametrically opposite
conception.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Editor of the <cite>Manchester Guardian</cite>, and controller of
its editorial policy.</p>

</div>

<p>In the stead of the Delanes and the Northcliffes,
we have control by self-seeking
millionaires with a megalomaniac itch for interference.
A dozen years ago, the spectacle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
of a newspaper proprietor expressing on the
front page of his principal organ his entire
disagreement with the opinions of his dramatic
critic on an entirely undistinguished
play would have been incredible. Such an
outrage on taste is symptomatic of the dictatorship
by the new Overlords of the Press.
Here we have yet another manifestation of
the amateur’s conception of journalism.
Anyone, thinks the modern proprietor, can
be a dramatic critic, a musical critic, a literary
critic, a Parliamentary correspondent,
an editor, especially if his name be known to
the public in a capacity entirely unrelated to
journalism. If he be a peer or possess a
courtesy title, then he is the beau ideal of
journalism.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> “Anyone can write leading articles,” the author was
once solemnly assured by one of our best-known editors.
He was neither endeavouring to be humorous nor to be
cynical; he was merely expressing what the Conductors
of the Press themselves think of the Press which they
conduct.</p>

</div>

<p>Amateurishness and the love of interference
also combine to give us the ponderous
signed contributions with which newspaper
proprietors regularly favour their own journals.
Whether these articles are in every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
instance, or in any instance, actually written
by their signatories, is a matter with which I
have no immediate concern. But they are
significant of the driving forces behind the
modern Press Trust; they exemplify the rôle
of the Press as an engine of propaganda, self-advancement,
and self-advertisement, for its
millionaire owners.</p>

<p>To quote Mr. St. John Ervine:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We know there are certain demented millionaires
who own newspapers and will write for
them; and when one of these men writes an article,
the staff hides its head and goes about the rest of the
week explaining it away. We (the journalists) are
the paper. We are the goodwill of the paper, and
when they sell a paper they sell what we have
made. When they sell what we have made and say
‘We don’t want you any more,’ we should be
regarded as the first charge on the price of that
paper. We have known proprietors who have
ruined papers. Such a man should be in gaol for
ruining a good business.... Editors used to put
the proprietors of newspapers in their place, and
there is no reason why it should not be done again.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Ervine, it may be added, made these
remarks at a meeting convened by the Institute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
of Journalists on December 11, 1926,
under the chairmanship of Sir Robert Bruce,
editor of the <cite>Glasgow Herald</cite>. His remarks
were, of course, boycotted by the leading organs
of the Press Trust.</p>

<small><i>The Mannerisms of Stentor</i></small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A problem for the consideration of
the Dictators of the Press is that of
reconciling the up-to-date nature of the modern
newspaper in most respects with its extraordinary
conservatism in others, an inconsistency
that affords genuine amusement
to the student of contemporary life and manners.
The Press is still old-fashioned enough
to regard Woman (with a very large
“W”) as a remarkable creature that has
only just been discovered. Her slightest and
most inconsequential doings are regarded as
of the most compelling interest. “Women
Present at Football Match” declaim the
headlines, and the game is immediately
vested with a special and romantic atmosphere.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> I do not dilate on this theme, since it has so admirably
been expounded by Rose Macaulay, who is human enough
to rebel against her sex being treated by the Press as
though it were almost human.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>Again, we have progressed beyond the
“Book of Snobs,” but “public schoolboy,”
“old Etonian,” “wife of Ex-M.P.,” and
“Colonel” are still imagined by sub-editors
to be invested in the reader’s mind with an
aura denied to the mass of human beings.
As for members of the nobility, let an
amiable and undistinguished peer die of heart
failure in his eightieth year, or collide in his
motor car with a taxi-cab, and the news is
conveyed to a bored public by means of
special contents bills. For the public is
bored, when it is not disgusted, by these endeavours
to make the world safe for Snobocracy.
Yet a journalist who attempted to
point out that both social values and news
values had altered since the days of the
Great Exhibition, and, in particular, since
the Great War, would be told that he did
not know his business and that he was most
certainly a Bolshevik.</p>

<p>Again, while proprietors and editors long
ago realised the implication of Northcliffe’s
discovery that Woman was a creature of
sufficient intelligence and curiosity to read<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
a newspaper (even if only for the advertisements
of drapers), they still regard her in
the light of an intellectual crétin so far as
concerns the provision of reading matter. If
any critic consider this statement too severe,
let him—or her—concentrate exclusively for
the next two days on the fashion and “Society”
columns and the “Woman’s Pages”
of the Popular Press.</p>

<p>Moreover, the editorial conception of
women is that they are without exception
possessed of inexhaustible means, leisure, and
ability to make holiday at expensive resorts
all the year round and to attend all the costliest
“functions” as a matter of course. No
other explanation of the fatuous drivel
offered up for the special delectation of female
readers offers itself to the reasoning
mind.</p>

<p>Do you think I have been unfair? Then
read this characteristic paragraph from an
evening paper, headed “Earnest Young Women”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It must not be thought that the American girl
merely dances her way through life. Not at all.
She must have variety, therefore she dabbles lightly
in art, literature, politics, or philanthropy. She has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
days for visiting hospitals or other institutions or
she makes political speeches as Miss Barbara Sands,
grand-daughter of Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt, has
been doing recently, and as Sarah Murray Butler
does all the time, or she even takes up business in
her odd moments, like Elinor Dorrance, who at
eighteen has decided to know all about the famous
Campbell soups company of which her father is
head and which she will inherit.”</p>
</div>

<p>This is not parody. It is the real thing,
complete with snobbishness, clichés, naïveté,
and the conviction that it doesn’t in the least
matter how you write or what you write
about so long as you are writing for other
women. And it is published in a paper whose
owners lay stress on the fact that it caters
especially for intelligent and cultured womanhood.</p>

<p>“The famous Campbell soups company.”
“Famous” is the sub-editor’s favourite
word,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> applied by him with unwearying zeal
to all men and women who have ever got
themselves in the public eye—unless they are
really famous—applied even to furniture
polishes, blends of whisky, and popular cigarettes.
The sub-editor, that romantic soul,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
also assumes that the normal behaviour of
the notorious or the merely well-known is
flamboyant, so that when they manage their
affairs without limelight they are “quietly
married,” or they “leave quietly” for their
honeymoon. The one thing the Press will in
no circumstances permit them to do is to die
quietly.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> “Amazing,” “mystery,” “thrilling,” and “dramatic”
are also hot favourites in the Stock Phrase Stakes.</p>

</div>

<p>Is it not time that the pages of the Press
were one quarter so up-to-date as the machinery
which prints them? and that “journalese”
should cease to be a synonym for
the vapid, the crude, the provincial, and the
semi-illiterate?</p>

<p>Impartiality being even rarer than commonsense,
no one would be foolish enough to
demand from a newspaper either complete
lack of bias, or the presentation with equal
prominence of both sides of a controversial
case. Such impartiality would be contrary
to human nature. But natural prejudice does
not necessarily involve the deliberate distortion
of news.</p>

<p>News can be, and is, habitually manipulated
both by distortion and suppression.
The first procedure is, on the whole, less objectionable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
since a little knowledge on the
part of a reader will often enable him to
realise that a case is being overstated. Moreover,
he may allow for the known political
complexion of a journal. Suppression assumes
two shapes, partial and complete. The
latter, which is the more unusual, comes into
play when a newspaper does not find it convenient
or politic to give publicity to events
or ideas, but this reticence does not necessarily
spring from sinister or interested motives.
Indeed, it may simply be because the
news editor, who lives in a curious world of
his own, often remote from the contacts of
the outer world, and who is avid only of
stereotyped sensations, fails to recognise
news when it is thrust under his nose. In
such instances, a rival may possibly recognise
“news value.” Or again, he may not.</p>

<p>This partial suppression, of which the
Socialist newspapers are quite as guilty as
the so-called “Capitalist Press” denounced
by them for the practice, is one of the deadliest
weapons in the armoury of journalism.
Let it be clearly understood that we are concerned
here not so much with a matter of unfairness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
or injustice to an individual or a section
of the community, as with injustice to
the community as a whole, which is deliberately
and systematically deprived of knowledge
of all the facts necessary to form a
judgment regarding the issues at stake in a
question which may affect the national well-being.</p>

<p>For instance, it is impossible for the average
newspaper reader to form a detached
opinion of the rights and wrongs of a coal
strike. The miners’ wages are alternatively
exaggerated and minimised; exceptionally
high earnings in the coal fields are paraded
as typical of the average for the industry as
a whole; or the earnings of coal hewers are
represented at much below the real level on
the strength of figures including the wages
of boys and surface workers. All these facts
are readily available and accessible in any
modern newspaper office. But only a selection
of them is published by any one paper.</p>

<p>Again, to take an example of complete
suppression, the curtain may never be lifted
by the Press on a political or other scandal
of which the exposure is emphatically in the
public interest. Such a boycott may be just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
as much due to the belief that the subject
has no news value as to any ulterior reasons.
But the injury to the community is the same
in either event. Newspaper readers are not
concerned with the motives animating editors
and proprietors; they <em>are</em> concerned
with the results of those motives.</p>

<small><i>The Newspaper of To-Morrow</i></small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The professional will not, of course, be
entirely eliminated from journalism.
Despite their love of the amateur, newspaper
proprietors realise that his place is not
among the reporters, the news editors, the
sub-editors, the financial editors, or the “art
editors”—whose concern lies not with art,
but with news photographs. As to editors,
that is another matter. The rôle of editor
tends more and more to become that of conduit
pipe between staff and proprietary,
whose views and policy he is called on to expound
and further. So that the amateur
will add the editorial chair to his Press conquests.
Indeed, he has already made a beginning.</p>

<p>One figures the popular “dailies” of the
next decade, with their signed articles by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
film stars, politicians, jockeys, footballers,
tennis players, and racing motorists. One
visualises their Women’s Page, Beauty
Hints, and Guide to the Fashions, ostensibly
conducted by popular actresses whose time
is already fully occupied in meeting the conflicting
claims of the Stage and of “Society.”
One foresees the daily sermon by the proprietor’s
pet divine, and the daily health article
by the medical man who regards the
stylo as more lucrative than the scalpel. One
foresees also an immense increase in the number
of photographs and other pictures, aided
by the development of telephotography, television,
and air transport. The motorist, the
golfer, the collector of antique furniture, the
amateur gardener, the investor, will find
more space devoted to their special interests.
There may even be room for an increase in
the amount of space (if not of the quality)
devoted to book reviews, although this forecast
is admittedly optimistic. (What the
public is supposed to want is not literary
criticism, but “gossip” about the personal
habits, the clothes, the recreations, the holidays,
and the monetary earnings of authors.)</p>

<p>The leading articles will remain, partly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
through conservatism, and in part because of
their utility for purposes of propaganda and
“uplift.” The serial story will improve in
quality, since that is one of the logical sequences
of the passion for well-known names.
More and larger prizes will be awarded for
guessing contests and other competitions.
The scope of newspaper insurance will be extended,
although this function may ultimately
be curtailed or even cease when the process
of Trustification has gone so far that individual
journals will no longer be under the
necessity of trying to abstract each others’
readers. The pictures and stories for the
nursery (and what the nursery really thinks
of some of these efforts for its entertainment
would surprise their purveyors) will be
raised to the dignity of a whole page, complete
with editor, the latter probably the
wife of an ex-Cabinet Minister. The Sabbath
will be kept holy by an increase in the
space devoted to autobiographies of contemporary
criminals and the retelling of old
crimes. In short, the Newspaper will have
travelled a stage further on the road to supplant
the book, to supplement the playhouse.</p>

<p>It is pertinent at this point to refer to one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
of the seeming paradoxes of the modern
Press, the diminution of its influence as its
circulation and wealth have increased.
Strictly speaking, the process has rather been
one of a shifting of the centre of influence.
When circulations were small, readers belonged
to the influential classes. A leading
article in the <cite>Times</cite> could cause the Cabinet
to reflect, could influence European chancelleries,
could even exercise a definite effect on
projected legislation. In much the same way
as the importance of the individual voter has
diminished with every broadening of the
basis of the franchise, so has the nature of
the old influence of the Press on public affairs
declined with growth in circulations.</p>

<p>“Government by newspaper” has been
denounced by politicians when the views expressed
by a journal have not happened to
coincide with theirs, but hitherto it is the endeavour
rather than the realisation which
has been criticised. A newspaper can and
does influence the Cabinet in relatively unimportant
matters, such as the propriety of
commercial advertising by post-mark; it no
longer succeeds in swaying the Administration
in the matter of a first-class legislative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
measure, or in inducing it to sanction a reform
or a change desired by the majority of
electors; despite almost unanimous newspaper
criticism of the retention of certain
war-time regulations, such as those governing
the hours during which it is licit to sell
chocolate or cigarettes, the Home Secretary
is still able to say that he is so far unaware
of any widespread public demand for a relaxation
of these restrictions.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Since this has been written, a committee has been set
up to inquire into the regulations in question.</p>

</div>

<p>But against the decline in the direct political
influence of the Press there has to be set
the growth of its influence over the community.
The expansion both of circulations
and of the field of interests catered for by
the newspaper, already touched on in these
pages, has helped immensely to develop the
“newspaper habit.” It is a matter of elementary
psychology that the average man
and woman cannot help being influenced by
the day-to-day exposition of political and
other questions in the columns of their newspapers.
Let any journal adopt the consistent
policy of blackening the leaders of
Soviet Russia or belauding Mussolini, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the infamy of the Bolsheviks or the disinterestedness
and greatness of the Italian dictator
becomes a creed to hundreds of thousands.
Let the whole Press unite in the same
shout, and that is the tendency under its
present controllers, and the result is mass
suggestion of a nature and intensity which
causes the Press to mould the public opinion
of whole nations. So that although an individual
newspaper or a combination of newspapers
may be powerless directly to affect
the policy of a Cabinet, it is daily operating
to sway the minds of the people and thus, indirectly,
to sway Governments through the
ultimate effect of mass suggestion in action
during the period of a general election or a
political crisis.</p>

<p>And this is the work of a handful of men
who—it is no reproach to them—are temperamentally
unfitted for the enormous responsibilities
which they have assumed so
light-heartedly, so casually—as casually as
though they were “cornering” chewing
gum.</p>

<p>Newspaper proprietors assert that in fact,
their editors have a free hand, and attempt
to prove this contention by pointing to differences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
in policy or treatment manifested by
newspapers under the same control. One is
at some difficulty in deciding whether this
argument is the fruit of ingenious or of
merely ingenuous minds. The <cite>Evening
Standard</cite>, for instance, may not see eye to
eye with the <cite>Daily Express</cite> in such matters
as the morality of modern dancing or the retention
of old churches in the City of
London, but a strike, a political crisis, a
general election, the issue of war or peace,
will witness a unanimity of editorial comment
which goes beyond the limits of sheer
coincidence. The <i lang="fr">mot d’ordre</i> has been
given.</p>

<p>The Press of to-morrow will have to regard
wireless and the kinema as potential
rivals. Both occupy a position analogous to
the newspaper, inasmuch as their popularity
is largely due to the lack of mental resources
in the average man and woman, and their
active disinclination to read anything calling
for concentration or sustained effort. The
Popular Press, Broadcasting and the
“Movies” are alike variants of the “Daily
Dope.” Furthermore, the Press has itself
largely helped to popularise its potential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
competitors through the immense publicity
which it accords them.</p>

<p>In England, broadcasting has hitherto not
trenched on the province of the newspaper
because of the archaic restrictions imposed
on the transmission of news by wireless,
which is virtually limited to a brief re-hash
of the evening papers, together with weather
forecasts. But it is impossible that these restrictions
will be allowed to prevail indefinitely,
even if only for the reason that
“listeners-in” are able to compare the service
with that provided by Continental broadcasting
agencies, who are not fettered by the
Mandarins of the Post Office. As a matter
of fact, the new British Broadcasting Corporation,
which is a Government Department,
possesses powers to do almost anything
that can be done by a newspaper. Some
of those powers it will certainly use, and
there is nothing to prevent the Corporation
from adding to its functions that of purveyor
of propaganda for the Government of
the day. The transmission of official news,
and the development of an Inter-Empire
news service it will certainly undertake.</p>

<p>But these are relatively minor matters.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
The real competitive possibilities of wireless
lie in the fact that it brings the outer world
into the homes of the millions at precisely
those hours between the publication of the
latest evening paper and the appearance of
the morning paper at the breakfast-table. As
the bulk of the contents of a morning paper
are printed well before midnight, wireless
transmission of news from seven o’clock in
the evening until eleven or twelve would skim
the cream off the next day’s papers. Whether
the Press should retaliate by establishing a
wireless service of its own (impossible in
England save by means of coöperation with
the British Broadcasting Corporation, which
possesses a double-riveted, State-enforced
monopoly) or by issuing later editions of
the evening papers than is now customary,
will become a matter for the consideration
of its conductors.</p>

<p>For, insofar as concerns the dissemination
of news, the wireless can clearly do as well
as, if not better, than the newspaper. And
it can do it at smaller cost to the subscriber.
No one would, of course, seriously suggest
that wireless transmission of news will drive
the newspapers out of business, or even that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
it will seriously affect their circulation or
revenue. But it is obvious that if broadcasting
compete with the Press in the publication
of news (and the Press will be powerless
to stop it in England and unable to do so
elsewhere unless wireless be brought within
the scope of Newspaper Trusts) then the
Press must strengthen its hold on the public
in those fields where wireless cannot compete,
or cannot compete so well. So it will enlarge
its field of comment. It will become more
and more of a miscellany. It will devote
more and more attention to crusades and
“uplift.” It will become more and more of
a pulpit, and a lecture theatre for the physician.
Above all, it will more and more strive
to mould public opinion.</p>

<p>The rivalry of the Kinema will be of a
subtler and less direct nature. Both the
Popular Press and the “Pictures” appeal
largely to a class which is easier to reach
through the eye than through an appeal to
the intellect, which demands a little imagination.
The popular newspapers have lately
begun to break out in a pictorial eczema
throughout their pages. But the kinema,
with its extremely well-organised service for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
recording and exhibiting events of the hour,
leaves the newspaper miles in the rear. An
evening paper can print photographs of the
Derby or the Boat Race within a few minutes
of their being taken. But it cannot show
the whole progress of the race within a
couple of hours after it has been run. Television,
already a scientific achievement, and
to-morrow a possible “commercial proposition,”
will also come to the aid both of the
Kinema and the Wireless. How does the
Press propose to meet the actualities of the
picture theatre and the possibilities of new
inventions for the photographic recording
and reproduction of events?</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">The Trustification of the Press has gone
further in England than in America or
on the Continent, partly because of such specially
favourable conditions as the small size
of the country, the excellence of its communications,
and the presence of an exceptionally
large proportion of the population within a
radius of a score of miles from the centre of
the capital. But there is nothing to suggest
that other countries represent more favourable
soil for the continued propagation of an
Independent Press.</p>

<p>As has been said, neither legislation nor
public opinion is competent to arrest the
progress of combination, or to operate
against Combines already in existence. Incidentally,
the awakening has come too late,
and although there is in this instance no lack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
of wisdom after the event, the utmost that it
can effect is to instruct the community as to
the nature and control of its newspapers.
It is powerless to vary the nature of either.
There are, it is true, alternatives to the Trust
in the shape of Government control or
ownership on behalf of a political party or
group<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, but these merely oppose one form of
dictatorship to another. Such control is
characterised by no real independence, which
obviously, cannot exist in the case of a
Government organ. Political or Governmental
control is, it is true, less objectionable
from many standpoints than control by a
Trust, while it also possesses the negative advantage
that identity of ownership is usually
less easy to camouflage. But such journals
are not and cannot be independent. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
long run, the same vices of partiality, suppression,
and distortion are present in a
newspaper whose aim is the support of a
political party or group as in one belonging
to a Trust, while a Government organ has
no other raison d’être than that of a vehicle
for thinly-disguised propaganda. Possibly,
the future may see more of Governments as
newspaper owners, even if only during
periods of national emergency, such as
strikes or wars.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> Last year, the <cite lang="fr">Journal des Débats</cite> was sold to a banker
and an ironmaster (the former is Baron Edouard de
Rothschild), both of whom hold strong views on the revalorisation
of the franc. The London <cite>Daily Chronicle</cite>,
in which the controlling interest had previously been held
by Mr. Lloyd George, passed at the end of 1926 into the
control of another Liberal group, and into the ownership
of a company of which Lord Reading is the chairman.
Some months earlier, the Government of the German
Reich acquired the <cite lang="de">Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</cite>, which
had been acquired by the Prussian Government the
previous year.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> During the General Strike of 1926, the British Government
maintained a daily paper, which was conducted
under the personal supervision of Mr. Winston Churchill.</p>

</div>

<p>But if legislation and public opinion be
powerless to check the growth of Combines,
the more intelligent section of the public,
aided by those few influential journals that
have still eluded the tentacles of the Octopus,
is at last disturbed in its mind. Trustification
of the Press has come to be regarded
as a public danger, and as of still worse
omen for the future. It is conceived of as a
menace by the politician—always hostile to
and ready to impute sinister motives to any
journal which fails to praise him—who visualises
the possibilities of all the battalions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
of the Press Czars suddenly being arrayed
against his party. Its dangers have been perceived
by the commercial community. Any
Government which fails to reckon with the
sudden conversion of a Press, yesterday
friendly but mobilised against it to-day as
the result of overnight change of ownership,
personal spite, or thwarted ambition, is
singularly unfit to govern, even in an age of
incapable and hand-to-mouth administrations.</p>

<p>The malady has thus at least been diagnosed.
But the patient is not easily curable.
The Combines can be challenged only by
comparable weight of metal, and they are
entrenched too firmly to render attractive
any attempt at competition. It almost
seems, therefore, as though the community
must resign itself to Stentor, with his vulgarities,
his inanities, his subservience to the
whims and interests of his owners, and his
greed for profits and yet more profits.</p>

<p>Given, however, a sufficiently aroused degree
of public opinion—and here we are
dealing with the incalculable and the unpredictable—and
a remedy is not entirely lacking.
One of the most characteristic and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
creditable features of the history of the
Press is the great influence that has been exercised
in the past by organs of small or relatively
small circulation and revenue, daily,
weekly, and monthly. Some of these still
exist, and although both their influence and
their independence have largely departed,
they yet stand as sign-posts on the road to
defeating the complete monopoly of the
Trust Press.</p>

<p>Courage and public spirit are admittedly
required for a revival of independence in
journalism, but the prospect is not without
its promise of reasonable financial gain in
addition to that of less tangible rewards.
Intelligent men and women are daily becoming
more disgusted with a Press that sets
sensation before truth and has raised vulgarity
to the level of an exact science. Even if
the Dictators should realise the existence of
this attitude—and they have no criteria beyond
circulation and revenue—they would be
unable to meet it. You can do many things
to and with a newspaper, but you cannot
change its spirit overnight with the same
ease as one of our most widely-circulated
journals once swung round in twenty-four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
hours from the advocacy of a Protective
tariff to the championship of Free Trade because
its earlier attitude was considered to
be unpopular among its patrons.</p>

<p>Circulation and advertising revenue (the
advertiser provides the real profits) are the
twin gods of the Dictators, as the reduction
of expenditure is their prophet. Thinking
in terms of millions, they are temperamentally
incapable of realising the influence of journals
appealing only to thousands, just as they
conceive influence to be synonymous with circulation,
although some of the “best
sellers” among our daily and Sunday papers
are singularly destitute of any real influence
over the drugged minds of their readers.
So there is scope for the re-emergence of
the independent organ of the type which has
demonstrated in the past that great influence
may go hand in hand with small circulation
and an inconsiderable revenue from drapery
advertisements, provided that its conductors
are informed with sincerity, fearlessness, and
ideals, and refuse to regard the shibboleths
of the minute as divine revelations.</p>

<p>And if such a Press do not emerge from
behind the smoke screen and the poison gas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
ejected by Stentor, then Democracy will have
the newspapers it deserves.</p>

<p>Let it be emphasised that the objections
on public grounds to the Trustification of
the Press are based even more on the future
than on present conditions. The Dictators
of to-day may be high-souled patriots, men
of vision, men alive to the measure of their
responsibilities. The Dictators of to-morrow
may be mercenary profit-seekers, reactionaries,
men who use their newspapers as
weapons in the fight against decent housing
or fair wages, or who bring up their
battalions in aid of campaigns to starve education
or foment war. There is nothing to
prevent the Press of this or any other country
from coming under the financial control
of armament makers, international traffickers
in drugs, or wealthy men who desire the
perpetuation of the slum. There is nothing
to prevent its domination by aliens or the
worst type of “market-rigging” financier.</p>

<p>That is to say, there is nothing save public
opinion, which is itself hamstrung by the
passing of the Independent Press.</p>

<p class="cap">The growth of the Newspaper Combine
has become so complex, with its interlocking
directorates and the holdings of one
company in another, that details would
weary the reader. But in order that he may
understand the process, the following is
given as a typical example.</p>

<p>The Amalgamated Press, of which Sir
William Berry is chairman, was formed at
the end of last year to take over another
undertaking of the same name. This is one
of the Northcliffe ventures, which grew so
amazingly that it eventually owned over a
hundred weekly, fortnightly, monthly and
annual publications; ten libraries; the Waverly
Book Co. Ltd., which is concerned with
educational publications; the Radio Press,
Ltd.; two other publishing concerns; and
controlling interests in one of the largest
paper-making concerns in the country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
and in a Canadian paper company owning
over a thousand square miles of timber
land. The new company also took over
a dozen publications from Cassell &amp; Co.
Ltd.</p>

<p>Sir William Berry is also the chairman of
Allied Newspapers, Ltd., which owns the
share capital in Allied Northern Newspapers,
Ltd., and owns or controls the London
<cite>Sunday Times</cite>, and a considerable number
of morning, evening and Sunday papers
in Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow and elsewhere,
including the <cite>Daily Despatch</cite>, the
<cite>Sunday Chronicle</cite>, the <cite>Empire News</cite>, the
<cite>Daily Record</cite>, and the <cite>North Mail and Newcastle
Daily Chronicle</cite>. At the end of last
year, the company also agreed to buy all the
ordinary shares in the Daily Sketch and Sunday
Herald, Ltd.</p>

<p>This list is far from giving a complete
record of Sir William Berry’s interests,
which also include the chairmanship of the
companies owning the <cite>Financial Times</cite> and
the <cite>Western Mail</cite>, the latter one of the leading
newspapers in the West of England. But
the details are sufficient to illustrate the process
whereby publications of the most varied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
nature and influence, and appealing to specialised
local interests all over the country
as well as to the public as a whole, have been
and are being brought under a common control.</p>
